## FAQ
preemptive responses to likely faq:

**What is the difference between a music library manager and a music player?**  
*A music player only plays music, a music library manager lets you manage your entire music collection.* Exactly how much power software needs to qualify as a music library manager is debatable, but the primary things I'm looking for are: the ability to organize music on the system into playlists; the ability to modify mp3 tags; the ability to add album art, the ability to group tracks by album, release date, and artist. For the record, I consider there to be some overlap between library managers and players, as some library managers play music. So some software will be both on this list and on the music players list.
