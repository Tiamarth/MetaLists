## Footnotes
1. I was unable to get Listen to play anything, so I can't confirm whether it supports mpris.  
2. There is an unofficial desktop client for Google Play Music which does support Linux: [GPMDP.](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/) It's both open source and has mpris integration.

## FAQs
Preemptive responses to likely FAQs:

**Does my music player's interface style matter?**  
*No.* Use what you prefer. I suppose, technically, a gui music player has a heavier footprint on your system's resources than a cli player. But on the vast majority of systems it should be negligible to the point of irrelevance.  
(Although, some people claim cli music players tend to play audio back more accurately.)

**Why aren't VLC, WMP, or (insert some other popular media player) on this list?**  
*This is a list of music players,* and those are media players. Media players are capable of playing video files as well as audio files. Music players are strictly capable of playing audio files. There will be a list for media players on this subreddit at some point in the future.
