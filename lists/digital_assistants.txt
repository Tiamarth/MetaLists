## Note  
This list is slightly different from the others here, in that it takes non-Linux platforms into account. This is because there aren't currently very many digital assistants out there, but they're a pretty cool technology, so I was interested in which platforms they're all available for. Some of these, such as Cortana, Alexa, and Google Assistant, are also available on standalone devices made by their respective companies.
