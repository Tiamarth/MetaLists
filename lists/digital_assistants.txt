## Note  
This list is slightly different from the others here, in that it takes non-Linux platforms into account. This is because there aren't currently very many digital assistants out there, but they're a pretty cool technology, so I was interested in which platforms they're all available for. Some of these, such as Cortana, Alexa, and Google Assistant, are also available on standalone devices made by their respective companies.

Dragonfire is a part of a bigger project called [Dragon Helmet](http://dragon.computer/) which aims to provide an augmented reality experience which is very Iron Man-esque. Based on promotional material on their website, it seems like an open source Google Glass with a bigger display in a helmet. But Dragonfire is available independently of the helmet for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros. They also plan to ship her with their own custom Linux distro, called DragonOS, which has not yet been released. Dragonfire is also available in the form of a [Twitter bot.](https://twitter.com/DragonfireAI)

Mycroft is an open source and customizable digital assistant which comes with various optional voices.

Alice is [Yandex's](https://yandex.com/) digital assistant. She's only available in Russian, and as far as I know is only available as an integrated feature in the [Yandex Browser.](https://browser.yandex.com/) I'm not positive that's true, but I don't speak Russian. The Yandex Browser is available on Windows and Linux, thus so is Alice.

Alexa is available on Windows [from the Windows store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/alexa/9n12z3cctcnz), but not on Linux or Mac. She's also available on Android [via the Google Play store,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app&hl=en_US) and she's also available in Amazon's flagship Alexa devices, [Echo.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07456BG8N)

Cortana is Microsoft's digital assistant and is shipped with their latest operating system, Windows 10. In addition to the other platforms listed above, she's also available in Microsoft's flagship Cortana devices, [Invoke.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/harman-kardon-invoke-with-cortana-by-microsoft/8rl7xlnwn95v)

Google Assistant is Google's digital assistant and is shipped with their phones and tablets. She's also available on iOS and in Lenovo's [Smart Clock](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/smart-clock) and Google's [Nest Cam IQ.](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_iq?hl=en-US&GoogleNest&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy6Lz3afa3gIViKDsCh1bjQPEEAAYASAAEgJhTvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
