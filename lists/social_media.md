## FAQ
preemptive responses to likely faq:

**What's the difference between the different types of social media?**  
- *aggregator:* these services aggregate links and provide a platform of discussion to users. Reddit is a well known aggregator.
- *blogging:* these services tend to emphasize individual users and provide a platform for them to post longform, substantive information about their daily lives. Tumblr is a well known blogging platform.
- *microblogging:* these services tend to emphasize individual users, but posts on these services are typically limited to small character counts. Twitter is a well known microblogging platform.
- *networking:* these services tend to emphasize relationships between users. Facebook is a well known networking platform.

**Does it matter if a social network is decentralized?**  
*Only if you care about not having to rely on one individual company.* Decentralized social media are hosted in a network of servers that aren't all dependent on the continued operation of the parent company. Generally decentralized platforms are also open source so that independent developers and tech-savvy users can host their own instances of the platform to keep the service running indefinitely, regardless of the state of the parent company. Current mainstream social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, will go offline permanently if the parent company goes out of business, and all of your data on those platforms will be rendered inaccessible.

**Does it matter if a social network is open source?**  
*Only if you care about absolute transparency in your social media platform of choice.* Open source is a term which refers to the license of software, in particular open source refers to software whose original source code is perusable and modifiable by independent third parties. Generally speaking, open source software is more trustworthy because third parties can read the source and confirm what's happening behind the scenes. Another potential benefit of open source software is that, if the original developers discontinue or abandon the project, third party developers can pick it up and keep the product up and useable. Again, if the parent company of Facebook and Twitter goes out of business, those platforms will go permanently offline along with your data. Since they are not open source, there will be no way for interested third parties to keep the services running.
