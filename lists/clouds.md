## FAQ
preemptive responses to likely FAQ:

**What is a cloud storage service?**  
*A cloud storage service allows users to upload and store data privately on a remote server.* This does not include services which allow users to upload data temporarily for the purpose of sharing it with other users. This also does not include services which allow users to upload exclusively extremely specific data such as images, music, or documents. For example, imgur is not a cloud storage service, neither is WeTransfer.

**What do the figures in the free size column mean?**  
*Those are the data limits for free accounts of the respective services.* For example, without giving Google any money, you get 15 GB of storage space on their servers for free. If the row says the free size is "unclear," that just means I couldn't find how much space a free account gets with that service. If it says "0 GB" that means the service isn't free, so you don't get any space for free with that service. If it says "unlimited," that means it's a self-hosted service, which means it's only technically limited by how much space you dedicate to it on your server.

**Does it matter if a cloud is self-hosted?**  
*Yes.* If a service is self-hosted that means you need to host it yourself, they're hosted on your own personal server. So you need to have your own storage space and maintain your own server to use those services. I'd generally recommend you use a self-hosted solution if you are able to, simply because it gives you significantly more control over your data.
